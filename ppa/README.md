PP attachment
=========

This is a utility for exploring PP attachment task following the initial (Ratnaparkhi et al. 94) task setup (RRR).
It is designed to explore to which extend we can encode world knowledge style representations into simple neural networks.

It also serves as a test for the neural network library. 

Principle
---------

We consider a quad as described in RRR, that is a $(V,X_1,P,X_2)$ quadruple of dicrete random variables with an additional variable $A$ describing whether $X_2$ attaches to $X_1$ or to $V$.
